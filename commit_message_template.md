# Commit Message Template

Start each commit message with "Fixes" followed by the issue number the code addresses, followed by a description of code/issue fixed, keep messages brief, if you need to include a longer discription do so in the pull request.

#### exapmle:

"Fixes #<issue number>, <desciption>"
